# battleship
I just created a game named battleship using python and somehow my code is not giving the most correct output. Any help is welcomed!!!
Just make it look and play like the original battleship game.
i have completed the game today in java training lab, its 5/4/17 15:02 right now and i am very happy with this game running successfully.
